# :wave: Welcome to the Open Data Hub project! 

### Quickstart
<details>
<summary>Data Browser</summary>
The [Open Data Hub Tourism Data Browser](https://databrowser.opendatahub.com) allows to access all the Open Data available in the Tourism domain by simply browsing the content of the various datasets.<br>
You can simply use those data for your convenience, or you might even find a novel way to exploit those data and use them in an app or portal you are going to develop. A detailed howto is available: How to use the Open Data Hubâ€™s Tourism Data Browser? to help you getting acquainted with the browser.
Currently, the Data Browser is being developed to be able to access also data in the Mobility domain as well.

<summary>Analytics tool</summary>
Open the Analytics for Mobility web page, at https://analytics.opendatahub.bz.it/ This portal uses data in the mobility domain to display various information about the sensors, including their locations, what they measure, and actual data in near-real time. You can retrieve data gathered by the sensors directly from the dataset, in almost real-time.
